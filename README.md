This is an individual summer research project sponsored by Grinnell College during summer 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Fahmida Hamid. The research has been accepted to the 33rd FLAIRS conference.

To run this program, download all the data.csv.zip files and two source code in Jupyter Notebook. Other csv files can be created by running the "MMTD Data Processing.ipynb". The final are saved in "Artists Recsys with Evaluation all (train-test = 60-40).ipynb". The "Song Recommender System.ipynb" is a program that is still in process.
